Basic bootstrap project

Only html5 and bootstrap.

No actual functional programming

Purpose was to just to use bootstrap at a basic level
Get familiar with grid system, and bootstrap set up
Play with different styles available via bootstrap

Don't worry. I know it's ugly.  Beauty was not the objective here.
