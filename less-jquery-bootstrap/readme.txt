Mini project using less, bootstrap and two jquery functions.
Leveraging bootstrap grid system
using less to nest, make color variables, and compile into css file.

I made a fictional digital marketng agency run by whales.
Just because I can.

*to do still*

make icons
make repeated background pattern for banners.
